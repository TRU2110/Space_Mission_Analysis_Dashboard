🚀**Dashboard Overview**

► In response to the project request and problem statement,I have developed a 2-page Power BI dashboard <br>

►First is all about KPI and different visual using DAX query
►Second page is all about Successful mission.

These elements are designed to offer a quick and engaging glimpse into the challenge and its key components, facilitating easy navigation and understanding for users.
